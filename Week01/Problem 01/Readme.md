# Q1658. Minimum Operations to Reduce X to Zero
---

Given a list of numbers and a target value x, you need to find the minimum number of operations to reduce x to zero. Each operation involves removing numbers from the list either from the start or the end.

### Constraints:
```
- 1 <= nums.length <= 105
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 104
- 1 <= x <= 109
```

## Approach
1. *Calculate Target Sum*: Find the difference between the sum of all numbers in the list and x. This gives us the target sum we need to achieve.
2. *Check Special Cases*: If the target sum is 0, it means the sum of all numbers equals x, so we return the length of the list. If the target sum is negative, it's impossible to reach the target sum, so we return -1.
3. *Sliding Window Technique*: We use a sliding window to find the longest subarray with a sum equal to the target sum. This helps us minimize the number of operations needed.
4. *Update Max Length*: Keep track of the maximum length of the subarray with the target sum.
5. *Return Result*: Calculate the minimum number of operations required by subtracting the maximum length of the subarray from the total length of the list.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the size of the list.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as no extra space is used except for variables.
