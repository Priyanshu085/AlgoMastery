The provided code aims to find the count of elements with the maximum frequency in a given vector of integers. Let's discuss the approach and make necessary corrections to the code:

### Approach:
1. **Frequency Counting:** Use an unordered map (`freqCounter`) to count the frequency of each element in the input vector `nums`.
2. **Find Maximum Frequency:** Iterate through the `freqCounter` map to find the maximum frequency (`maxFrequency`) among all elements.
3. **Count Elements with Maximum Frequency:** Iterate through the `freqCounter` map again and count the number of elements that have a frequency equal to `maxFrequency`.
4. **Calculate Answer:** Multiply `maxFrequency` by the count of elements with maximum frequency (`maxFreqElements`) to get the final answer.

### Code Correction:
- The function name should be `maxFrequencyElements` instead of `maxFrequencyElements`.
- The function should return an integer representing the count of elements with maximum frequency, but the current implementation returns the product of maximum frequency and count of elements with maximum frequency. So, the final answer should be just `maxFreqElements`.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the size of the input vector `nums`.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), for storing the frequency count of each element in the unordered map.
